    Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the
    list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong
    order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed,
    which indicates that the list is sorted.

    Bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm because of its poor
    performance. It has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) on average, which makes it
    inefficient on large data sets. However, bubble sort is a simple algorithm
    that is easy to understand and implement, which makes it a good choice for
    educational purposes and simple cases.
