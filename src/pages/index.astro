            Welcome to Chechu’s sorting visualiser! Here, you can see how
            different sorting algorithms work on a variety of customisable data
            sets, all in real-time. I’ve optimised my visualiser to run smoothly
            on all devices, and I’ve added a speed slider and an element
            selector to allow you to customise your experience. Plus, I’ve added
            a unique satisfying touch by incorporating sound, in the form of a
            frequency for each value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re just curious, a beginner looking to understand the
            basics of sorting, or a more advanced user looking to compare the
            performance of different algorithms, my visualiser has something to
            offer you.

        My visualiser will be including a range of popular sorting algorithms
        soon in time, while for the moment there is only selection sort and
        insertion sort, there's no limit other than imagination to which
        algorithms to include: Bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort…
        All of them and more are going to get into this website soon!
      </p>
          <p>
            You can select the algorithm you want to see in action, choose how
            many elements you want to sort, shuffle it, and there you go! As the
            algorithm works, you’ll see the data being sorted in real time,
            making it easy to understand the steps involved.
          </p><p>
            You can also see the big O notation of each algorithm and compare it
            with an easy-to-understand table showing how many operations have
            been made in real time along with many other details.

      <p>I hope you enjoy using my sorting algorithm visualiser.</p>
